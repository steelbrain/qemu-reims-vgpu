 * walk could not be made correct: address_space_translate_internal() clamps

 * page in high RAM into that slice. The harvest reads a page it cannot resolve
 * as written — the conservative answer, and the right one for a page that is
 * genuinely gone — so every tracked surface then reported itself permanently
 * overwritten by the guest. The hull never shrank and the clear pass skipped
 * unresolved pages, so nothing could undo it for the life of the VM.
 *
 * Downstream that is a guest-visible latch, not a slow path: every host-side
 * copy of a surface is declared stale, the type-11 sampled rung refuses its
 * resident and merges guest pages that never held the composite, and deferred
 * render windows report `deferred_flush_clobber`. It reads as backdrops going
 * transparent and popover geometry breaking, until the guest is rebooted.
 *
 * A range is kept whenever it is `ram`, including device BARs and flash. A
